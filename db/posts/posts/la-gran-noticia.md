# Easy, local development
Build websites with modern tools like
 Vue.js,  GraphQL & all the power of Node.js & the JavaScript ecosystem. Develop locally and get instant hot-reloading for any code change.

## Fast by default
Gridsome builds ultra performance into every page by using the PRPL pattern. You get code splitting, asset optimization, progressive images, and link prefetching out of the box. Gridsome sites get almost perfect page speed scores by default.

## PWA-ready
Gridsome generates static PWAs. Only critical HTML, CSS, and JavaScript get loaded first. The next pages are then prefetched so users can click around incredibly fast without page reloads, even when offline.
